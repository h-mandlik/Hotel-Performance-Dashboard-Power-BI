- **DAX Measures** for key metrics:  
  
  -- Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)
  RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue], [AvailableRoomNights])

  -- Realization Percentage
  Realization% = DIVIDE([UtilizedRoomNights], [BookedRoomNights]) * 100

  -- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
  ADR = DIVIDE([Revenue], [BookedRoomNights])
